/// Note that this future abstracts over two different asynchronousprimitives: dedicated-thread
/// semantics, and stream asynchrony.
///
/// # Dedicated-thread semantics
///
/// In this crate, all operations that use CUDA internally are off-loaded to a dedicated thread (the
/// runtime). This improves CUDA's ability to parallelize without being interrupted by the OS
/// scheduler or being affected by starvation when under load.
///
/// # Stream asynchrony
///
/// CUDA has internal asynchrony as well. Lots of CUDA operations are asynchronous with respect to
/// the host with regards to the stream they are bound to.
///
/// It is important to understand that most of the operations in this crate do *NOT* actually wait
/// for the CUDA asynchronous operation to complete. Instead, the operation is started and then the
/// future becomes ready. This means that if the caller must still synchronize the underlying CUDA
/// stream.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// To create a [`Future`], move the closure into with `Future::new`:
///
/// ```
/// # use async_cuda::runtime::Future;
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// let future = Future::new(move || {
///     ()
/// });
/// let return_value = future.await;
/// assert_eq!(return_value, ());
